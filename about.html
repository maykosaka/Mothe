<h2>biography</h2>
<p>May Kosaka grew up in and around New York City. After receiving her Bachelor’s Degree
in Computer Science, she realized that there was adifferent singular calling for her. 
Her interests in art & the construction methods of clothing led her to New York’s 
Fashion Institute of Technology, where she received a degree in Fashion Design.
In 2005, she was commissioned to design conceptual garments as part of Parthenogenesis, 
an art installation for the <a href="http://www.thearmoryshow.com">Armory Show</a>, the world’s leading art fair devoted exclusively 
to contemporary art, as well as New York’s largest. After the incredible response to her work 
by artists & the general public at the show, she has decided to start infusing the same 
aesthetic into clothes that all women can wear.

<h2>design philosophy</h2>
<p>At MOTHE, we approach the construction of clothing as a fine art and a science. 
Our concepts and forms take their  inspiration from the organic structures of the natural 
and  man-made forms that surround us in our daily lives. Our goal is to create unique 
silhouettes executed with intelligent design. The name MOTHE embodies a return to 
a mutable and more natural state; it evokes a sense of deepness, of rich organic powder, 
of a comforting darkness that speaks to women’s instinctive senses
